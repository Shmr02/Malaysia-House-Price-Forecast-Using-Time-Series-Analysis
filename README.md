# Malaysia-House-Price-Forecast-Using-Time-Series-Analysis
This study examines Malaysia’s house price trends from 2009 to 2024 using quarterly data from Bank of International Settlements (BIS) portal. As housing demand rises due to urban growth and population increase, affordability has become a major concern. Factors like interest rates, inflation, income, and supply-demand dynamics influence price fluctuations. Time series methods such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and Exponential Smoothing are applied to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and forecast future prices. The findings provide valuable insights to support data-driven decisions by policymakers, developers, and investors toward achieving sustainable and affordable housing in Malaysia.

The objectives of this project are:
To develop a forecasting model for Malaysia’s house price using the Box-Jenkins model and exponential smoothing model.
To validate the accuracy of the developed forecasted model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
To forecast the housing price in Malaysia using the best forecasting model.
